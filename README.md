# Quant-Finance-Resources
**Courses, Articles and many more which can help beginners or professionals.**

*Finance is mostly details, and just having the ability to systematize and categorize and focus on details can be a huge advantage.* by Micheal Burry 

This resources are specifically meant for **engineers or mathematicians**. Most of the courses are Math or Coding heavy. Take it at your own risk.
## Courses and Lectures
> **Note:** Courses listed below will NOT show any Coursera or Youtube Fams, because those courses are open for all (Anyone can take it,    Medical doctor or lawyer can, if needed.) I don't want to (or want you to) spend time in these courses because these courses gives you flavour of subject and not deep understanding. Being an engineer, I want to (wish the same for you) use my already learnt mathematics skills to advance further in topic and dive deep, to do some meaningful work or research.
