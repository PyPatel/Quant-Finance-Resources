# Quant-Finance-Resources
**Courses, Articles and many more which can help beginners or professionals.**

*Finance is mostly details, and just having the ability to systematize and categorize and focus on details can be a huge advantage.* by Micheal Burry 

This resources are specifically meant for **STEM grads**. Most of the courses are Math or Coding heavy. Take it at your own risk.

### About me
I work as a Quant Trader in High Frequency Trading firm focused on Indian Markets in Equities and F&O. I did my Masters (M.Tech) and Bachelors (B.Tech) from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in Automotive Engineering.

## Courses and Lectures
> **Note:** The courses listed below will NOT show any Coursera or Youtube Fams, because those courses are open for all (Anyone can take it,    Medical doctor or lawyer can if needed.) I don't want to (or want you to) spend time in these courses because these courses give you a flavor of the subject and not deep understanding. Being an engineer, I want to (wish the same for you) use my already learned mathematics skills to advance further in the topic and dive deep, to do some meaningful work and push the boundary.

> If you had Udemy courses and say "I know ML", I will lash you with a wet noodle (No offense to udemy).
